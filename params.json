","body":"Environs\r\n==========\r\n\r\nFor both hosts and participants, a lot of times doing an Android based code-lab or workshop feels like being given a box of screws and a hammer, and being told 'get to work'. One of the major problems is that getting the Android development environment set up initially is not trivial, and fairly error-prone. As a result, many times workshops end up being mostly about setting up development environments, and very little about actually building stuff. \r\n\r\nThis project provides a VirtualBox image, along with instructions, that can be distributed on a flash drive, with everything set up and ready to go. \r\n\r\n* Download the image from here: http://goo.gl/W6OQA7\r\n* Verify the MD5 sum: 935f80992c6d4ec638382f9626a2fe7a\r\n* Extract the archive, then import the .ova file into VirtualBox 4.3\r\n* Fire it up\r\n* Credentials are dev/dev (user/pass)\r\n\r\nA few notes:\r\n\r\n* You must be running on an x86_64 host.\r\n* SDK and Studio are installed in ~/bin/\r\n* Code lives in ~/workspace/\r\n* Many Glass samples have been pulled down, and imported into AS\r\n* There should be NO EMULATORS (obvious performance issues)\r\n* Other things installed:\r\n    * Emacs\r\n    * Maven\r\n    * Vim\r\n    * Java 7\r\n    * Android Studio 1.0.2\r\n\r\nSuggestion:\r\n\r\nIf you want to use this in your own workshop, pull it down, and try it out first. If you have a specific sample project(s) that you want to use, pull it down, import it, and test it out before putting this on a bunch of flash drives.
